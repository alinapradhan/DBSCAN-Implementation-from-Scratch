# DBSCAN Implementation from Scratch

This repository provides a Python implementation of the **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)** algorithm.The notebook demonstrates how DBSCAN works, step by step, with visualizations and comparison against scikit-learn's implementation.

## Features
- Custom implementation of DBSCAN from scratch  
- Handling of core points, border points, and noise  
- Visualization of clustering results  
- Parameter tuning (eps, minPts) for optimal results  
- Comparison with scikit-learn DBSCAN  

##  Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (for comparison)

## Example Output
* Clusters formed based on density
* Noise points correctly identified
* Visual comparison with scikit-learn DBSCAN
